# Karl - Hugo theme

This is a minimal theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static site generator. It is
heavily heavily inspired by Karl Seguin's awesome blog - [openmymind.net](http://openmymind.net)

The theme is under development. Use at your own risk or even better - fork,
improve and do a pull request.

View it in action at [bitshift.me](http://bitshift.me). Tnx.
