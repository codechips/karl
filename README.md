# Karl - Hugo theme

This is a minimal theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static site generator. It is
heavily heavily inspired by Karl Seguin's awesome blog - [openmymind.net](http://openmymind.net)

The theme is under development. Use at your own risk or even better - fork,
improve and do a pull request.

View it in action at [bitshift.me](http://bitshift.me). Tnx.

## Rules

- All posts go straight under content.
- If you want to add a regular page tag it with "type = meta" in front matter.
- Only tags are supported. No categories.
